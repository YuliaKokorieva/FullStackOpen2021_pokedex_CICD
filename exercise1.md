#CI/CD with Python
1.	CI setup steps:
-	Linting: PyFlakes, Pylint, pycodestyle, pydocstyle
-	Testing: PyUnit, PyTest
-	Building: PyBuilder
2.	Alternatives in CI setup:
“there are many popular options like TravisCI, CodeShip, and Semaphore. Big enterprises often have their custom solutions, and they sell them as a service, such as AWS CodePipeline, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, and Oracle’s Hudson”. (source: https://realpython.com/python-continuous-integration/) 
3.	Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why?
It fully depends on the size of the project. For a smaller project that would be cloud-based environment, for a bigger one – self-hosted environment.
